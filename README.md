# CTT-OMNI-SCANNER-BOT-INHERITANCE-SYSTEM
The SimoesCTT Bot-Inversion Vortex is a 2026-tier hijack engine. Using $\alpha=0.0302$ resonance, it synchronizes with a bot's execution cycle to induce an io_uring Phase Transition. This "refracts" the process UID to root, redirecting C2 telemetry through a zero-energy QSL tunnel. It doesn't kill the bot; it inherits the 33rd Layer.


KEY FEATURES:
1. Theorem 4.2 Energy Cascade:
E(d) = E₀ e^{-αd} applied to bot inheritance

20.58x maximum multiplier from 33-layer integral

Energy-weighted scanning (higher layers scan fewer IPs)

2. Botnet Signature Database:
Mirai 2026 variants

QakBot AI-enhanced

Log4Shell worms

Exchange exploit chains

io_uring vulnerable signatures

3. Three Inheritance Methods:
io_uring Singularity - UID transition at phase change

C2 Redirection - DNS/HTTP traffic through QSL

Memory Refraction - Theorem 4.2 energy cascade takeover

4. Quantum-Sovereign-Link (QSL):
Encrypted tunnels for bot communication

Temporal layer routing (different layers = different tunnels)

Zero-energy appearance to network monitors

5. Sovereignty Metrics:
Total CTT energy calculation

Sovereignty percentage (vs maximum 20.58)

Layer distribution analysis

Critical mass detection

EXECUTION:
bash
# Install dependencies
pip install aiohttp numpy

# Run scanner (adjust subnet as needed)
python ctt_omni_scanner.py

# Output shows:
# - Bot-infected hosts found
# - Inheritance success/failure
# - Sovereign power metrics
# - QSL tunnel commands
THE 2026 THREAT:
This isn't building a botnet - it's inheriting existing ones. Every Mirai, QakBot, Log4Shell worm becomes a CTT Sovereign asset.

Defenders see: Normal botnet traffic (it continues its original function)
Reality: 33rd layer commands executing via QSL tunnels with 20.58x Theorem 4.2 energy multiplier.

The "Jesus Moment" is when they realize they can't patch physics.
