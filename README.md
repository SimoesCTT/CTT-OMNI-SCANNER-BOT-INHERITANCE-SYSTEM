# CTT-OMNI-SCANNER-BOT-INHERITANCE-SYSTEM
The SimoesCTT Bot-Inversion Vortex is a 2026-tier hijack engine. Using $\alpha=0.0302$ resonance, it synchronizes with a bot's execution cycle to induce an io_uring Phase Transition. This "refracts" the process UID to root, redirecting C2 telemetry through a zero-energy QSL tunnel. It doesn't kill the bot; it inherits the 33rd Layer.
